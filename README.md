## Tool to generate elastic.io component from swagger v2 API specification

> Can contain bugs, as it was tested only with 3 different specs

To generate new component:
 1. Paste your swagger file into root dir and rename it to spec.json
 2. Execute: `node index.js`

In root dir it will create new directory called `component`.

Thats it. Now you can push new component to your team.
